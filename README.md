## OTM

On The Map (OTM) allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves “on the map,” so to speak. 

## Usage
This project requires a udacity account to login. Upon login the user is presented a map of the locations of other Udacity representd by pins. The user can add his/her location on the map. There is also a table view showing the list of recently updated locations of users. This project requires xcode 7 and Swift 2.0 or later to run.
